# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.

ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

#NEXT I determined what artist released the longest song 
SELECT artist_name,

LIMIT 1

#Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, 
their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
